# Tasks
 
## Task 1

For the first task which is to store data in a smart way and get the required data quickly.

I have implemented a Streamlit website where filtering data to get the required reports immediately is just a click away.

The following operations have been implemented:

    1) Add new data with heart images and signal data. The heart images and signal data are organised and the file paths are stored in PostgreSQL database.
    
    2) Filter data on any column. Data can be filtered based on Age, Gender, Health Conditions, Hospital, and the respective unit of the hospital.

Here is a short video of demonstration:

## Task 2

For Task 2, I have worked with the ECG Fragments dataset and have built a classifier using CNN for classifying between fragments that contain a Ventricular Flutter or Fibrillation and the ones that do not.

The accuracy achieved by CNN on Test data is 94.48%. This accuracy was achieved by saving the best model using training where I have early stopping method to save the best model. The training graphs are shown below:
